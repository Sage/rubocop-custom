Container for custom Rubocop checks, called cops.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-custom-cops'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubocop-custom-cops

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

### Rails/ErrorsAddWithSymbol

```ruby
# bad
person.errors.add(:name, 'this text is already translated')

# good
person.errors.add(:name, :proper_key_from_local_file)
```

Background: our API provides error messages in a general, English form, as well as localized in the users languages. This is only possible when the translation happens inside `errors.add`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
